User-Based Jeju Island Travel Destination Recommendation System

# Abstract
In an era where personalized experiences are highly valued, the travel industry is evolving to meet the diverse needs and preferences of travelers. This is particularly true for destinations like Jeju Island, renowned for its unique blend of natural beauty, cultural heritage, and recreational opportunities. To enhance the travel experience and provide tailored recommendations, we propose the development of an AI-driven machine learning program designed to suggest optimal travel destinations in Jeju Island based on individual user preferences and objectives.

The proposed system will leverage advanced machine learning techniques to analyze a range of variables including travel preferences, interests and objectives. By processing this data, the system will generate personalized travel recommendations that align with the user's specific needs. This approach aims to improve user satisfaction by ensuring that each travel suggestion is relevant and tailored to the individual's unique profile.

Our goal is to create a robust and adaptive recommendation engine that not only simplifies the decision-making process for travelers but also enhances their overall experience by providing insightful and customized suggestions for exploring Jeju Island.
